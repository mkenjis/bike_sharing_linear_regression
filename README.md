# Purpose: 
- use bike sharing dataset to train different linear regression models.
- use trained model to identify which ones have a better performance.
		 
# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objective : 
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a MLlib linear regression models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
